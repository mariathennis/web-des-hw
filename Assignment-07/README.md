While browsing the web I have come across many forms that serve a whole bunch of different purposes. One of them was a survey asking what ads i liked best and i had to choose what some of my interests were and from there they choose what ads i got. The next was for a class i had and it was a quiz so i had to choose what was the correct answer. The other one i have experienced was customer feedback after i was online shopping, and on top of that when i had to sign up/ make an account it required some sort of form for me to fill out.
